# A lens to undistort sinusoidal scan trajectories

This Jupyter notebook computes and plots the local curvature of a (hypothetical) lens that would allow to undistort the temporal sinusoidal scan path created by a resonant scanner into a linear trajectory.

The idea of such a lens is discussed in a broader context in a blog post on my [neurophysiology blog](https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/09/27/alvarez-lenses-and-other-strangely-shaped-optical-elements/). The short summary is that such a lens would be theoretically feasible, but of limited usefulness.
